# MNIST

In this project, I am going to implement a Deep Neural Network using TensorFlow 2.0 in a dataset called MNIST, which is about handwritten digit recognition. This is a classification problem.

The dataset I am going to use is the one provided by TensorFlow datasets and consist of 70,000 images with 28x28 pixels of handwritten numbers. That means, each image corresponds to a number between 0 and 9.

My goal is to write a deep learning algorithm that identifies the handwritten number of the given images.
